This folder contains the mod cache for solder. There are several folders:

 * mods - this is the cache for mods. It's managed automatically by MinecraftSolder
 * modpack - this is the cache for modpack metadata. It's managed automatically by MinecraftSolder
 * cached_version.txt - This is the current version of the modpack to be served as recommended. It's managed
automatically by the mod.
 * clientmods - Folder for client-only mods. Drop the files you would put in /mods on the client here. They will be
picked on next cache build (next increment of version in minecraftsolder.cfg)

These are optional files managed manually.
 * logo.png - A 370x220 logo for your modpack. Shown in the launcher and on your modpacks platform page.
 * icon.png - A 50x50 icon for your modpack.
 * background.png - A 900x600 background for your modpack. Shown in the launcher.
